Facebook, which has a bidding product called maximumbidding, has recently introduced a product called averagebidding as an alternative to this product. Our client bombabomba.com decided to test this new feature. And they want to do an A/B test to see if averagebidding converts more than maximumbidding. The A/B test has been going on for 1 month and bombabomba.com is now waiting for you to analyze the results of this A/B test. The ultimate success criterion for Bombabomba.com is Purchase. Therefore, the focus should be on the Purchase metric for statistical testing.
